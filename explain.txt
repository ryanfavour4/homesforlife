2 main folders were created
1 for the components and another special for each page
similar to next js


the styles have a comment describing 
the begining and end of a particular js file
instead of scoping


Services.js is the component right underneath 
the hero section ( the first top face of a landing page )


Adcopy.js is the description text on the hero section
( advertise copy text )


react icons is the extra installed package
